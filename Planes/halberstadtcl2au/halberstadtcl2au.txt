&name=Halberstadt CL.II 200hp
&description='Halberstadt CL.II design was a response to an Idflieg (Inspectorate of Aviation Troops) specification issued in august of 1916 for a new "light C-type" with 160-180 engine.

The purpose was to create a two-seat escort fighter to protect heavier observation aircraft from attacks of allied fighters. In November of 1916 Idflieg ordered three prototypes of the Halberstadt CL.II with Mercedes D.III engine, with the first ready airplane was rolled out in April of 1917. After a few wing design changes the type was undergoing final tests in Adlesdorf during 2-7 May 1917.

Deliveries of machines into frontline service begin by August 1917, being supplied mostly to Schutzstaffeln (Protection flights), and Schlachtstaffeln (Ground attack flights). Its climb and maneuverability was excellent and it was regarded by its crews as very close to such single-engined fighters as the Albatros D.III/V. While the airplane was able to carry photo and radio installations, and primarily used as escort fighter, it was also used as ground attack aircraft. Because of its good maneuverability and ability to rapidly change flight altitude it was able to avoid enemy ground fire, and was successfully used to hit enemy ground troops and other frontline installations.

Because of its good performance and ability to hold itself against enemy fighters, and being light and comfortable to fly, the CL.II was preferred by pilots over all other types and remained in service throughout the whole war, serving together with new airplane types.

It is not exactly known exactly how many of the CL.II were built, but the production orders of 900 machines correspond to six Idflieg production orders for Halberstadter Flugzeugwerke, plus around of 300 machines by Bayerische Flugzeug Werke AG (in two orders), so it\'s approximately 1200 machines in total.

Mercedes D.IIIaü engine had improved performance at higher altitudes, but setting the throttle to full at low altitudes could cause detonation in the engine.
