&name=Albatros D.Va
&description='The engineers of Albatros Werke faced the task of building a fast and manoeuvrable fighter plane. The older Albatros D.III had a lower wing defect that led to failure of the wing in a steep dive. Having been unable to find out the reason of these failures, the engineers moved the aileron control wires from the lower wing to the top wing.
Test flights were carried out in the spring of 1917. Externally, the Albatros D.V differed from earlier Albatros models: it had a larger tail fin surface; the top wing was lowered closer to the fuselage; the radiator was set to starboard of the centreline, and the fuselage was more rounded.

Fighter squadrons began receiving the Albatros D.V in May 1917. Several months of combat experience showed that the lower wing problem had not been solved. In response, the engineers moved the aileron control wires back to the lower wing and strengthened the attachment point of the V-shaped strut to the lower spar with an additional strut. In addition, the more powerful Mercedes D.IIIa engine was installed. The updated plane was called the Albatros D.Va.

Total of 1650 Albatros D.V and D.Va aircraft were built at Albatros Werke and Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke.

The Albatros D.Va was mainly used against enemy aircraft. Pilots noted great visibility, handling, sufficient speed and rate of climb. The new engine improved the aircraft’s high altitude flight characteristics. However, pilots had no confidence in the new low wing attachment and refused to perform steep dives in combat. Despite this, veteran pilots continued to increase their combat scores, and employing large numbers of the aircraft in sorties became more frequent. This model participated in battles on the Western Front and the Palestinian Front.
