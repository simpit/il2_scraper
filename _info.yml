    Combat debut: spring 1942
    
    Operation features:
    - Engine has no manifold pressure automatic governor. For this reason, manifold pressure not only depends on throttle position, but also from RPM and altitude. This requires additional checking of manifold pressure to not cause engine damage.
    - Engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (66%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set mixture lever to Auto Lean (33%25) position. In the case of mulfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%25) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%25) position.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Oil radiators shutters are joint with engine cowl outlet shutters and manually operated.
    - Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane is equipped with a parking brake system.
    - Airplane is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.
    - Airplane is equipped with upper formation lights.
    - Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2900m (9500 ft) altitude.
    - Airplane have a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in left and right fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 15 seconds.
    - The aircraft is equipped with an electromechanical safety system that blocks the hydraulic landing gear actuator while the aircraft is on the ground.
    - The nose gear orients by itself, doesn't have brakes and can't be controlled.
    - It is forbidden to open the upper cowl flaps during flight, so they should be closed before taking off.
    - The upper cowl flaps are controlled simultaneously using a shared hydraulic actuator (use inlet shutter control ingame).
    - There are white and red signal lamps in the tail: the white one is lit while bomb doors are open and the red one lights up for 5 seconds when bombs are released.
    - The upper cockpit door can't be opened during flight, but there is an emergency jettison handle.
    - Airplane is equipped with a bomb salvo controller that has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.'
- name: Albatros D.Va
  description: |
    The engineers of Albatros Werke faced the task of building a fast and manoeuvrable fighter plane. The older Albatros D.III had a lower wing defect that led to failure of the wing in a steep dive. Having been unable to find out the reason of these failures, the engineers moved the aileron control wires from the lower wing to the top wing.
    Test flights were carried out in the spring of 1917. Externally, the Albatros D.V differed from earlier Albatros models: it had a larger tail fin surface; the top wing was lowered closer to the fuselage; the radiator was set to starboard of the centreline, and the fuselage was more rounded.
    
    Fighter squadrons began receiving the Albatros D.V in May 1917. Several months of combat experience showed that the lower wing problem had not been solved. In response, the engineers moved the aileron control wires back to the lower wing and strengthened the attachment point of the V-shaped strut to the lower spar with an additional strut. In addition, the more powerful Mercedes D.IIIa engine was installed. The updated plane was called the Albatros D.Va.
    
    Total of 1650 Albatros D.V and D.Va aircraft were built at Albatros Werke and Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke.
    
    The Albatros D.Va was mainly used against enemy aircraft. Pilots noted great visibility, handling, sufficient speed and rate of climb. The new engine improved the aircraft’s high altitude flight characteristics. However, pilots had no confidence in the new low wing attachment and refused to perform steep dives in combat. Despite this, veteran pilots continued to increase their combat scores, and employing large numbers of the aircraft in sorties became more frequent. This model participated in battles on the Western Front and the Palestinian Front.

    Operation features:
    - Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
    - To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
    - Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to +1° before takeoff and to -4°...-5° before landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
    - Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
    - Airplane has a manual mechanical system for retracting the landing flaps, for this reason it is necessary to extend landing flaps well before final approach. Markers on the left-wing flap indicate how far the flaps are extended. The flaps can be extended to any angle up to 42°.
    - Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining. Also, it has an emergency fuel warning light (80 liters).
    - The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.'

    Operation features:
    - Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
    - In addition to full-automatic mode there is a special emergency mode for the radiator shutters, which can be used in specific situations. In this mode, the shutters are forced to be fully opened.
    - To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
    - Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
    - Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to +1° before takeoff and to -4°...-5° before landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
    - Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
    - Airplane has a manual mechanical system for retracting the landing flaps, for this reason it is necessary to extend landing flaps well before final approach. Markers on the left-wing flap indicate how far the flaps are extended. The flaps can be extended to any angle up to 40°.
    - Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining. Also, it has an emergency fuel warning light (80 liters).
    - The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.'

    - Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
    - The aircraft is equipped with MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system that prevents the engine detonation in the emergency power mode. It engages automatically when the throttle is set to maximum, there is enough mixture for 25-30 minutes. However, the engine can work up to 10 minutes at this mode, wait for another 10 minutes at the combat mode before engaging the emergency mode again. Attention: running the engine at the emergency mode without the water-methanol mixture or at altitudes higher than 6 km is forbidden! A pilot can check the system using the injection pressure indicator on the left: its normal pressure is 0.6...0.7 atm, stop using it if the pressure is lower than 0.4 atm and switch the engine to combat mode.
    - In addition to full-automatic mode there is a special manual control mode for the radiator shutters, which can be used in specific situations.

    - Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
    - The aircraft is equipped with MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system that prevents the engine detonation in the emergency power mode. It engages automatically when the throttle is set to maximum, there is enough mixture for 25-30 minutes. However, the engine can work up to 10 minutes at this mode, wait for another 10 minutes at the combat mode before engaging the emergency mode again. Attention: running the engine at the emergency mode without the water-methanol mixture or at altitudes higher than 6 km is forbidden! A pilot can check the system using the injection pressure indicator on the left: its normal pressure is 0.6...0.7 atm, stop using it if the pressure is lower than 0.4 atm and switch the engine to combat mode.
    - In addition to full-automatic mode there is a special manual control mode for the radiator shutters, which can be used in specific situations.
    - To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.

    - Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°.
    - Airplane has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the remaining fuel in one of four fuel tanks depending on the switch position. In the game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has a low fuel warning light (50 liters) for each tank.
    - The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - Airplane is equipped with an automatic bomb salvo controller, it allows you to choose which bomb-racks to be released (central belly, left and right wing) and to switch the bomb salvo (single release or release all bombs).
    - Reloading of BK37 gun is performed by the rear gunner at the pilot`s command.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.'
- name: Bristol F2B (F.II)
  description: |
    Design of the Bristol started in March of 1916 as an intended replacement for the B.E. two seater Series. It was designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, but additionally the new type was also going to have to be capable of carrying out scout patrols.
    It was supplied with dual controls, wireless radio, camera equipment and armed with a fixed Vickers gun firing through the cowling and a rear turret with one or two Lewis guns.
    
    The first prototype Bristol F.2A flew in September of 1916, equipped with a Rolls Royce Mk.1 engine.
    After successful trials, the aircraft went into production. The first combat unit equipped with Bristols to arrive in France was No.48 Squadron, which arrived at the front on March 8, 1917.
    
    The first offensive patrol was flown on April 5, 1917, but proved to be a disastrous debut for the Bristol. The patrol consisted of six F.2As and was led by Captain I.V. Leefe-Robinson, V.C. When over Douai, they were attacked by five Albatros D.IIIs led by Manfred von Richthofen, who shot down two of the Bristols for his thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth victories. Two other Bristols, one of them flown by Leefe-Robinson himself, were also accounted for by Richthofen\'s pilots.
    
    This failure happened mostly due to old tactics used by the first Bristol pilots - as they used it to fly in close formation and only with defensive tactics. But later, as pilots gained combat experience, the Bristol proved to be a superior combat machine when used as a fighter plane.
    
    Later on, some changes were made to the Bristol airframe, and it was also supplied with new Falcon II and Falcon III engines, whereupon it was re-designated as the Bristol F.2B and became one of the best, if not the best, two seat fighter of the Great War.
    Due to a shortage of the Rolls Royce Falcon engine, a wide variety of engines were installed, such as 300hp Hispano, Raf 4a, Sunbeam Arab and Liberty engines.
    
    Fast, with a good climb rate, rugged, very fast in dives and flown by aggressive and experienced pilots, Bristols soon became feared by enemy opponents. Usually, German pilots chose to evade Bristols if the Germans did not have superior numbers.
    The most successful Bristol ace who flew F.2Bs as a pilot, Andrew Edward McKeever from No.11 squadron, scored an impressive 31 kills flying Bristols. However, his record was overshadowed by that of the highest scoring observer ace of the war, Charles George Gass, who scored 39 (!!!) kills while flying as a Bristol gunner!
    
    While excelling as a fighter, the Bristol was also capable of being a good ground attack aircraft. It could carry up to 450 lbs of bombs on external racks. Some of the Bristols were also equipped with a Negative Lens bombsight.
    Being a very successful aircraft, Bristol Fighters were used by RAF squadrons through the 1920s.
    A total of 3,101 Bristol Fighters were produced up until the end of 1918.

- name: Fokker D.VII
  description: |
    The Fokker D.VII was designed by Reinhold Platz of the Fokker-Flugzeugwerke. His task was to create a fighter capable of beating the French SPAD XIII and British S.E.5a fighters. Some notable design features of the type included a metal airframe structure, a thick-sectioned wing, and a lack of bracing wires.
    
    A competition among various new fighters took place in Adlershof from January 21st to February 12th, 1918, during the course of which the D.VII prototype proved to be the fastest, most durable, and the best-climbing aircraft. Manfred von Richthofen, a close friend of Anthony Fokker, also evaluated the prototype and noted some minor flaws. In particular, he noted the aircraft exhibited instability in a long dive, which was later corrected. The success of the design led to it being produced at a number of factories, including Fokker Flugzeugwerke, Albatros Werke, and the Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke. The Fokker D.VII would become one of the best - if not ultimately the best - fighter by the end of the war. In total, 2029 planes were produced and sent to the front by the end of 1918.
    
    The first production aircraft reached the frontline airfields of Bavarian squadrons in April 1918. The Fokker D.VII was used to escort bombers, engage enemy fighters, and attack balloons; it was rarely used for strafing enemy supply columns in the immediate battle area and for recon. During its initial service, it became clear that the water-cooled radiator did not cool the engine sufficiently. The problem was fixed by modifying the radiator facing, engine cowling, and by increasing the airflow through the cylinders.
    
    D.VII pilots noted the type’s good climb speed, excellent cockpit visibility, stability in manoeuvres, and good handling at low speeds. Pilots excitedly exclaimed, "The plane is like hanging on its propeller!" All of these attributes helped pilots in carrying out offensive and defensive missions. German squadrons equipped with this type were the main opponents of Allied aviation until the war’s end.

German squadrons equipped with this type were the main opponents of Allied aviation until the war’s end.
    
    The Fokker D.VII was generally equipped with the Mercedes D.IIIa engine, but a new BMW engine type with the D.VIIF designation was also fitted. This new high compression BMW engine with high altitude control gave the D.VII much better performance. Its climb rate was almost twice that as the Mercedes-equipped version, and when flown at maximum throttle the engine was capable of generating almost 250 horsepower at ground level for a short time. With a nominal rating of 230 horsepower and a newly designed carburettor, this engine very much improved the aircraft's high altitude performance and pushed the aircraft’s performance to a new level. However, there was a persistent shortage of BMW engines, and as a result, only every third or fourth aircraft had this type of engine installed.
    
    This BMW IIIa engine had a special control lever - "Höhengashebel" - which was used to gain more power at higher altitudes. Engaging it at lower altitudes could lead to engine malfunction (detonation).
    
    The D.VIIF was mainly supplied to the best and most proven frontline squadrons. As a result, the best German pilots were now able to outclass the latest Allied aircraft types in a plane superior to those of the Allies in almost every important aspect.

  description: |
    In the spring of 1917, during a visit to Jasta 11, Anthony Fokker inspected the construction of a captured British fighter, the Sopwith Triplane. Manfred von Richthofen related to Fokker the details of his dogfight with this new aeroplane. It was only due to his great experience that the Red Baron managed to avoid defeat.
    The prototype of the F.I (the name at the time of the Dr.I) triplane was made ready by August 1917. Some remarkable details of its construction were as follows: a steel tube fuselage frame, as well as metal frames for the stabilizer and tail fin; an absence of bracing trusses; and the placement of the ailerons on the upper wing. The plane was more compact and robust than the British Sopwith Triplane. In total, 320 Dr.I triplanes were built.
    On the 23rd of September 1917, Werner Voss shot down two British fighters while piloting an experimental version of the plane. Soon afterwards, he was attacked by six SE5s of the Royal Flying Corps. Each British plane was damaged in the course of this dramatic and historic fight, which forced two of their number to retire from the battle. It was only because he was outnumbered that the ace Voss unfortunately lost his life.
    By October 1917, the first production Fokker Dr.I planes were being delivered to fighter squadrons.
    The Fokker Dr.I triplane was a superb fighter, but it was rarely used to cover two-seater recon planes.
    Dr.I pilots reported an excellent rate of climb and manoeuvrability and a good view from the cockpit. Pilots reported, "You need only a light touch to swing this plane around!” Thanks to these features, the triplane pilot could decide whether to disengage from an attacking enemy or to attack an enemy plane. It could engage on even terms the king of the dogfight, the British Sopwith Camel, with a good chance of victory.
    RFC pilots were especially apprehensive of situations where the Fokker Dr.I and the Albatros D.Va were flying together in combat formation. The Fokkers would initiate the dogfight and the Albatros pilots would shoot down enemy planes attempting to disengage and leave the battle.
    By the spring of 1918, the plane was obsolete. Only the most outstanding German aces, masterfully piloting the plane and sharpshooting their enemies, continued to fly the triplane in combat.

    Operation features:
    - Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.
    - To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
    - When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.
    - Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
    - Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
    - Airplane has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13°) and landing (58°). Flaps control buttons and indicator lights are located on left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may also be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.
    - Airplane has a tail wheel lock system which locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or rear fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has an emergency fuel warning light (100 liters).
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The control system for the bomb rack only allows for dropping bombs one by one.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.'

There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.
    - There is an additional emergency engine mode system installed. When it is engaged, the first supercharger gear pressure increases to 1.58 ATA and the second gear pressure to 1.65 ATA, the time limit is 10 minutes. This system is turned on by the engine boost command and works only when the throttle is set to 100%25, automatic propeller pitch system is engaged and the altitude is lower than critical altitude for a given supercharger gear.
    - Outlet cowl shutters are operated manually.
    - To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.

    - The aircraft is equipped with MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system that prevents the engine detonation in the emergency power mode.
    - Radiator flaps are controlled automatically, keeping a set coolant temperature. This temperature can be set by a pilot using the thermostat regulator if needed (default 0%25 setting is adequate for all engine modes, while increasing it cools the engine more).
    - When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.
    - Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
    - Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
    - Airplane has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13°) and landing (58°). Flaps control buttons are located on left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.
    - Airplane has a tail wheel lock system which locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or rear fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has an emergency fuel warning light (100 liters).
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The standard bomb release controller allows dropping the bombs only one by one.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.'

  description: |
    Halberstadt CL.II design was a response to an Idflieg (Inspectorate of Aviation Troops) specification issued in august of 1916 for a new "light C-type" with 160-180 engine.
    
    The purpose was to create a two-seat escort fighter to protect heavier observation aircraft from attacks of allied fighters. In November of 1916 Idflieg ordered three prototypes of the Halberstadt CL.II with Mercedes D.III engine, with the first ready airplane was rolled out in April of 1917. After a few wing design changes the type was undergoing final tests in Adlesdorf during 2-7 May 1917.
    
    Deliveries of machines into frontline service begin by August 1917, being supplied mostly to Schutzstaffeln (Protection flights), and Schlachtstaffeln (Ground attack flights). Its climb and maneuverability was excellent and it was regarded by its crews as very close to such single-engined fighters as the Albatros D.III/V. While the airplane was able to carry photo and radio installations, and primarily used as escort fighter, it was also used as ground attack aircraft. Because of its good maneuverability and ability to rapidly change flight altitude it was able to avoid enemy ground fire, and was successfully used to hit enemy ground troops and other frontline installations.
    
    Because of its good performance and ability to hold itself against enemy fighters, and being light and comfortable to fly, the CL.II was preferred by pilots over all other types and remained in service throughout the whole war, serving together with new airplane types.
    
    It is not exactly known exactly how many of the CL.II were built, but the production orders of 900 machines correspond to six Idflieg production orders for Halberstadter Flugzeugwerke, plus around of 300 machines by Bayerische Flugzeug Werke AG (in two orders), so it\'s approximately 1200 machines in total.

    Combat debut: May 1942
    
    Operation features:
    - Controlling the propellers RPM is possible only in the manual mode by changing the propeller pitch. The automatic mode keeps the RPM at 2750.
    - The engine control lever allows setting the pressure up to the combat mode (1.25 ATA).
    - To switch the engines to the take-off mode, move the boost lever to 1.5 ATA position and set the propellers to 3030 RPM.
    - Engine mixture control is automatic. Leaning the mixture manually reduces the fuel consumption during flight.
    - The oil radiator shutters are controlled automatically and do not have a manual mode.
    - The propellers have a feathering system which should be activated in case of engine damage to reduce drag of the propeller in auto-rotation.
    - The aircraft has only pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.
    - The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 40° or to the fixed take-off position.
    - The tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - The aircraft fuel gauges are positioned directly on the engine nacelles and show only the amount of fuel remaining in the wing tanks (the fuel remaining in the central fuel tank is not indicated).
    - The aircraft isn't equipped with an oxygen supply system, so flying above 4000 meters is forbidden.
    - The aircraft is equipped with an electric bomb release controller that allows dropping the bombs only one by one.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.'

    Operation features:
    - Engine has a boost mode which is engaged by setting mixture control lever to maximum position.
    - Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
    - Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to the intermediate (50%25) position. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the control lever to less than 50%25. This will lower fuel consumption during flight.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Water and oil radiator shutter control is manual. Airplane has armoured oil radiator shutters which should be closed at the beginning of ground attack to reduce a possibility of combat damage. After finishing the attack, it is necessary to re-open the shutters to the required position.
    - Airplane has only the pitch flight-control trimmer.
    - Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be fully extended; gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
    - Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or bottom fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Rear fuel tank level is not indicated. 
    - Cockpit canopy weight is 50 kg and it has no lock in the open position, for this reason the canopy may to spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
    - Airplane is equipped with a joint salvo controller both for bombs and rockets, it has three release/fire modes: single launch, launch two in a salvo or launch four in a salvo.
    - The gunsight is installed on a sliding bar which allows the pilot to extend the gunsight towards the pilot allowing for an increase in the field of view through the gunsight.'

    - Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can be extended fully or to takeoff position - 17°, gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before the landing which will cause the aircraft to shoot upwards.
    - Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or bottom fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Rear fuel tank level is not indicated. 
    - Cockpit canopy weight is 50 kg and it has no lock in the open position, for this reason the canopy may to spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
    - Airplane is equipped with a joint salvo controller both for bombs and rockets, it has three release/fire modes: single launch, launch two in a salvo or launch four in a salvo.
    - The mechanical gun sight "Visier Vladimirova" allows aiming rockets and guns at ground and air targets and horizontal bombing at certain speeds and altitudes.'

    Combat debut: 1936
    
    Operation features:
    - Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
    - Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 1 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
    - All three propellers are fixed pitch ones, so thrust can only be controlled by adjusting the engines throttle (from idle at 25%25 to maximum power at 100%25). 0 - 20%25 throttle range is used for braking the landing gear wheels. Engine modes can be determined only by watching the engine RPM gauges.
    - Radiator bypass valve and engine cowls are controlled manually.
    - Pedals in the cabin are equipped with adjustable load feel mechanism to reduce the pilot's work load.
    - Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to 0° before takeoff, to +2° during flight and to -1.5° for landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight.
    - The mechanical flaps control system can be controlled simultaneously with the horizontal stabilizer, these two systems can be linked or unlinked (by using flaps control buttons). It is important to note that it is possible to render the system inoperable so it would not be able to control either the stabilizer or the flaps by deviating from a standard control procedure described below.
    - Before taking off, set the stabilizer to flight position +2°, engage the link and then move the stabilizer to take-off position 0° - flaps will be extended to 25°.
    - When airborne, move the stabilizer back to flight position (flaps should also fully retract) and  unlink these controls.
    - Before landing, set the stabilizer to flight position +2°, engage the link and then move the stabilizer to landing position -1.5° - flaps will be fully extended to 40°.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has separate pneumatic wheel brakes. To brake left or right wheels, move their corresponding left or right engine throttle to 20%25 or less. Setting the central engine throttle to 20%25 or less will brake both wheels. Maximum braking efficiency can be achieved by moving the trottle all the way down. In the sim, you can also use the brake buttons to move left and right engine throttles to braking position.
    - Airplane is equipped with a hydraulic tail wheel parking brake system.
    - Airplane is equipped with two mechanical fuel float level gauges for left and right fuel tank groups, located on the left and right engine nacelles outside the cabin.
    - Airplane has three mechanical oil float level gauges on each of the three engine nacelles outside the cabin.
    - Cargo unload doors can be opened on the ground only.
    - The left passenger door must be removed before flight for dropping paratroopers or cargo containers. Use the bomb drop button ("B" by default) to drop them.'

    Operation features:
    - The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an automatic switch system that switches gears depending on altitude and engine revolutions. It can also be manually switched to first gear.
    - Engine mixture control is automatic.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - Airplane has only the pitch and roll flight-control trimmers.
    - Airplane has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.
    - Airplane has hydraulic-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (25°) and landing (40°). Flap indicator lights are located on left panel near the throttle.
    - Airplane is also equipped with differential ailerons which are lowered in synch with the flaps.
    - Airplane has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps. The stabilizer control lamps are located near the throttle lever.
    - Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane have a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in left and right fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has indicator lights for full internal tanks and a low fuel warning light (160 liters) for each tank.
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. When the canopy is open, it is impossible to use rear gun because it is linked to canopy. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - Airplane has a window in the cockpit floor which can be opened by the bomb bay door command.
    - Airplane is equipped with a salvo controller, it allows the pilot to choose which bomb racks to use (central, left and right wing) and to switch the bomb salvo (single drop or all bombs on the rack).
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.
    - Aircraft is equipped with dive system. When the dive system is engaged, the plane enters a dive when the air brakes are extended and will recover from the dive either by pressing the bomb drop button or when the air brakes are retracted. The dive system controls are separate: the trimmer tab on the right elevator is controlled by the dive system while the pilot controls the trimmer tab on the left elevator. Therefore the pilot input and dive system input of the trimmers are independent, and when the dive system is in operation, there is no indication of a trimmer position change in the technochat.'

    Operation features:
    - Each engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an automatic switch system that switches gears depending altitude and engine revolutions. It can also be manually switched to first gear.
    - Engine mixture control is automatic.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Propellers have a feathering system which should be activated in case of engine damage to reduce drag of the propeller in auto-rotation.
    - Water and oil radiators shutters are joint with engine cowl outlet shutters and manually operated. Ground personnel may install additional fixed shutters on the intake of the oil radiators in cold weather to prevent freezing of the oil
    - Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
    - Airplane has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.
    - Airplane has hydraulic-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (25°) and landing (50°). Flap indicator lights are located on left panel.
    - Airplane has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps. The stabilizer control lamps are located near the flaps indicator lights.
    - Airplane is also equipped with differential ailerons which are lowered in synch with the flaps.
    - Lowering the landing gear takes a long time, for this reason it is necessary to extend the landing gear well before final landing approach.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane has dedicated fuel gauges for left and right fuel tank groups and there is a switch between the internal and external fuel tank group indicator. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has low fuel warning lights (180 liters) for the internal tanks.
    - Airplane is equipped with an automatic bomb salvo controller, it allows you to switch between the bomb racks to be released (internal or external) and to switch between different salvo quantities. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.
    - Aircraft is equipped with dive system. When the dive system is engaged, the plane enters a dive when the air brakes are extended or when the dive button (LCtrl + D by default) is pressed. The plane will recover from the dive either by pressing the bomb drop button or by pressing the dive button (LCtrl + D by default). The dive system will return to the neutral position of the elevator trim, while the full range of trimmer travel from the pilot’s input is preserved. Therefore the pilot input and dive system input of the trimmers are independent, and when the dive system is in operation, there is no indication of a trimmer position change in the technochat. Also, the elevator trim is automatically shifted when the stabilizer is moved to the landing position (when flaps are released to the landing position). This also shifts the trim back to the neutral position.'

    Operation features:
    - The engine has a boost mode. To engage it, increase the manifold pressure to 1180 mm Hg. Boost only works on 1st supercharger gear.
    - Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 3500m altitude.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Oil radiator, air cooling intake and outlet shutters are manually controlled.
    - Air cooling intake shutters should always be open. They should only be closed when there is a possibility of engine overcooling, for example in a dive with idle throttle.
    - Aircraft is equipped with elevator and rudder trimmers.
    - Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.

    Operation features:
    - The engine has a boost mode. To set boost mode it is necessary to push the boost knob and increase manifold pressure to 1140 mm Hg.
    - The boost control is effectively a limiter. It limits the pressure to 950 mm Hg in normal mode and to 1140 mm Hg in the boost mode.
    - Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 3500m altitude.
    - Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to maximum. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the mixture control to less than maximum. This also reduces fuel consumption during flight.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Oil radiator, air cooling intake and outlet shutters are manually controlled.
    - Air cooling intake shutters should always be open. They should only be closed when there is a possibility of engine overcooling, for example in a dive with idle throttle.
    - Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
    - Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.
    - Cockpit canopy has a weak lock when in the opened position, for this reason the canopy may spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
    - The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.'

    Operation features:
    - Throttle lever is inverted: backward = full throttle, forward = idle throttle.
    - Engine is equipped with automatic mixture control system and supercharger with fluid coupling which does not require manual control.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor with two fixed modes: 2200 RPM normal mode, 2400 RPM boosted mode. Also, it is possible to turn off the governor and control the propeller pitch manually by mechanical actuator.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
    - Airplane has asymmetric half-wings for roll-compensation: the left one is 20 cm longer than right one.
    - Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to neutral before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 45°. The flap system includes a "pneumatic spring" which allows flaps to be pressed upwards by airflow at airspeed more than 200 km/h.
    - Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which indicates only the front fuel tank level.
    - The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.
    - The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter. There is also a back-up folding mechanical sight which can be used if main sight is damaged.'

    Combat debut: Summer 1944
    
    Operation features:
    - The aircraft is equipped with two turbojet engines Jumo-004 B1. They are controlled automatically by the throttle which sets the turbine rotor RPM.
    - The engine is equipped with automatic fuel regulator that engaged only at more than 6000 RPM. Therefore, the fuel regulation at lower RPM wasn\'t effective and a careless throttle increase could cause excessive fuel intake, resulting in overheating and possible engine fire.
    - At high altitudes it is possible to lean the mixture too much by a sharp throttle decrease, causing a flameout and engine stop. The turbine shouldn\'t be set below 6000-8000 RPM depending on the altitude.
    - It is impossible to restart the engine at high altitudes (more than 4000 m).
    - The aircraft is equipped with horizontal stabilizer and rudder trim to reduce the load on controls.
    - The aircraft is susceptible to Mach tuck when diving at 0.84 M or higher speed. 
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 55°. The hydraulic valve controlling the flaps can\'t be turned during the landing gear operation (lowering or retracting).
    - Landing gear brakes are hydraulic as well and are engaged by pushing a corresponding pedal. The nose gear orients by itself (up to 50° in either direction), has a rotation dampener and dedicated brake handle. The aircraft tends to rotate during a breakaway unless the nose wheel is set forward.
    - There are two main (900 l each) and two secondary fuel tanks (600 and 170 l). The fuel transfer from secondary to main tanks using the electric fuel pump is initiated by the pilot when the fuel level in main tanks drops lower than 600 l. The main tanks have fuel level indicators and emergency fuel lamps (they light up when there are less than 250 l left).'

    Combat debut: July 1941
    
    Operation features:
    - Engine has a boost mode which is engaged by setting mixture control lever to maximum position.
    - Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
    - Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to the intermediate (50%25) position. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the control lever to less than 50%25. This will lower fuel consumption during flight.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - Airplane has only pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.
    - Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
    - Landing flaps have a limiter for the maximum angle. The flaps have an extended range from 0° to 50°. The landing flaps have pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be instantly extended to the angle which is set by limiter, gradual extending is impossible. Due to weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may retract upward by the airflow when the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. For this reason, it is necessary to remember that flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps right before landing.
    - Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked and made controllable by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than for 40%25 of its range. The tailwheel remans locked if pedals are deflected less than 40%25. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed, or be ready to control the airplane with an unlocked tailwheel should large rudder inputs be made.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
    - When bombs are installed there is a salvo controller, it has two release modes: single drop or drop two in a salvo.
    - When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.'

    Combat debut: 1944
    
    Operation features:
    - In addition to the automatic single-stage supercharger, each engine is equipped with the automatic turbo-supercharger.
    - The turbo-supercharger is powered by the engine exhaust backpressure and is regulated automatically by the pilot throttle control in the cockpit using the shutters on the exhaust pipes.
    - It should be noted that turbocharger RPM changes relatively slowly and not immediately after a control lever adjustment. For instance, during takeoff it's necessary to keep the brakes pressed for several seconds after moving the throttle to takeoff position and begin the run only when the turbocharger RPM increases sufficiently to reach 54 inches of pressure.
    - The automatic fuel mixture control maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (70%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce the fuel consumption during flight set the mixture lever to Auto Lean (30%25) position. In a case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control, the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (move the lever completely forward) position. To stop the engine, set it to the Idle Cut Off (0%25) position.
    - The automatic engine governor keeps the set engine RPM by adjusting the propeller pitch using an electric actuator (it is possible to turn it off and control the propeller pitch manually). The propellers can be feathered.
    - The aircraft has pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and can be extended to any angle up to 40°. There is also a fixed "maneuver" flaps position that can be set by a short flaps button press ("F" by default).
    - The aircraft is equipped with hydraulic aileron actuators, making their operation and good roll performance at high speeds possible. The actuators are turned on using a special valve on the left side of the cockpit and require at least 1200 psi pressure in the hydraulic system, so they should be turned off if there is only one engine running. In the sim, they are turned on and off automatically.
    - The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.
    - The landing gear indicator lamp lights up if the landing gear is neither extended nor retracted. The extension of the nose wheel can also be checked by its reflection in the mirrors on the inner sides of the engine nacelles and by the pressure drop in the hydraulic system during the landing gear operation.
    - There are signal lamps warning about the low fuel level in the outer wing tanks (the primary fuel source) and separate fuel indicators for the left and right fuel tank pairs.
    - The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The windows on the sides of the canopy can be lowered during flight, but this can cause the excessive shaking of the plane.
    - The electric bomb controller allows dropping the bombs one by one from the left and right racks or by pairs.
    - The unguided rockets are launched using the electric controller which allows single, pair, triple and salvo (all rockets at 0.1 seconds interval) launch. The rocket containers are jettisonable.'

    Operation features:
    - Engine has no manifold pressure automatic governor. For this reason, manifold pressure not only depends on throttle position, but also from RPM and altitude. This requires additional checking of manifold pressure to not cause engine damage.
    - Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
    - Engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (66%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set mixture lever to Auto Lean (33%25) position. In the case of mulfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%25) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%25) position.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM. Also it is possible to turn off the governor and control propeller pitch manually.
    - Water and oil radiators shutters are joint with engine cowl outlet shutters and manually operated.
    - Airplane has a very small stability margin in yaw. When angle of side slip is more than 12° plane becomes unstable in yaw and starts to increase the side slip angle by itself. Because of this, it is necessary to accurately operate the rudder pedals and pay attention to the side slip indicator.
    - Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 45°.
    - Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than half of its range. The tailwheel remains locked if pedals are deflected less than half way. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed.
    - Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - Airplane is equipped with a parking brake system.
    - Airplane has three fuel gauges which shows the level in each fuel tank.
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - Airplane is equipped with mechanical releasing system for a single bomb.

    Operation features:
    - In addition to the automatic single stage supercharger, the engine is equipped with a turbocharger that the pilot can control.
    - The turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust back pressure which can be set by a lever in the cockpit and maintained automatically using the throttle shutters on the exhaust pipes.
    - The air compressed in the turbocharger goes to the intercooler where it is cooled by the incoming airflow. The cool compressed air goes to the carburetor and the resulting fuel-air mixture goes to the supercharger.
    - The temperature of the air after the intercooler is indicated by a separate gauge. The pilot can control the intercooler flaps using the toggle switch and observe their position using the indicator on the left. Their default position is neutral (50%25).
    - The turbocharger RPM is controlled by the lever in the cockpit ("T" and "+"/"-" keys by default). At the back lever position the throttle shutters are fully open and exhaust gases all go to the atmosphere, resulting in minimal turbocharger RPM. At the forward lever position, the exhaust back pressure and the resulting turbocharger RPM are at maximum. It should be noted that the RPM will change with the altitude even if the lever is kept in the same position. The turbocharger RPM is indicated by a dedicated gauge; in addition, the signal lamp will light up if the maximum RPM limit is exceeded.
    - The total engine power should be controlled using the joint method when the three levers - RPM lever, throttle lever and turbocharger lever are moved together. However, in certain cases (for instance, when going higher than the critical altitude) the turbocharger lever should be adjusted separately.
    - It should be noted that turbocharger RPM changes relatively slowly and not immediately after the control lever adjustment.
    - The aircraft is equipped with the water injection system that boosts the power in the emergency mode. When this system is engaged, the exhaust back pressure and turbocharger RPM increase automatically while the mixture becomes leaner. The water supply is good for around 15 minutes at the emergency power.
    - The engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if the mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (85%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set the mixture lever to Auto Lean (60%25) position. In the case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%25) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%25) position.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM. Also, it is possible to turn off the governor and control propeller pitch manually.
    - Oil radiators shutters are manually operated.
    - The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
    - Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 40°.
    - It is forbidden to open the cowl flaps at speeds exceeding 225 mph, perform sharp maneuvers with the opened cowl shutters and dive with the opened intercooler shutters.
    - The aircraft has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
    - The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.
    - The signal lamp lights up when the landing gear is up and the throttle is in the backward position or when the landing gear is down, but the throttle is in the forward position.
    - It should be noted that the aircraft requires a long takeoff run - around 650 meters at standard load and 1500 meters at maximum takeoff weight. It is possible to lower the flaps to 10-20 degrees to shorten the takeoff run. 
    - The aircraft is equipped with one fuel gauge, but two indicator needles for the forward and rear fuel tanks.
    - The engine consumes much fuel at the combat power mode - around 4.5 gallons per minute.
    - The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The aircraft is equipped with the manual bomb release system for each of the three bomb racks.
    - The unguided rockets are launched using the electric controller which allows single, pair, triple and salvo (all rockets at 0.1 seconds interval) launch.
    - There is a backup mechanical sight which can be used if the main sight is damaged.
    - The gyroscopic gunsight automatically calculates required angular deflection while firing at a target. It has 3 modes: fixed reticle, fixed and gyro reticle, gyro reticle. The angular deflection will be calculated correctly only if the target range is set properly. To set the range, adjust the target base first using separate controls and then set the range by adjusting the size of the range-finding reticle to be the same as the target size.'

    Operation features:
    - Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2700m altitude.
    - Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM. The governor is electrically actuated and takes a long time to reach the required revolutions, up to 45 seconds when going from minimum to maximum.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
    - Airplane has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.

For this reason, it is prohibited to extend flaps to more than to 35° (70%25) on landing.
    - Airplane has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane has three fuel gauges which shows the level in the fuselage fuel tank, left wing tanks and right wing tanks.
    - The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - Airplane is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.
    - When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo. Aircraft has a fire control system that is designed for eight rockets. However, for added punch, ten rockets were typically loaded. In that case, the ninth rocket will fire with the seventh and the tenth will fire with the eighth.'

    - Airplane is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.
    - When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo. Aircraft has a fire control system that is designed for eight rockets. However, for added punch, ten rockets were typically loaded. In that case, the ninth rocket will fire with the seventh and the tenth will fire with the eighth.'
- name: Pfalz D.IIIa
  description: |
    The Pfalz D.III was designed by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke. German engineers were impressed by the famous French Nieuport fighters, which were designed with “one-and-a-half” wings. As such, Pfalz’s design was based on the achievements of French engineers. The first trial flight was carried out in May 1917. The plane’s design featured machine guns mounted on the sides of the engine and aileron control wires situated in the lower wing. Half a year later, the Pfalz D.IIIa was introduced. It featured a more powerful engine, a larger tail fin, a modified shape of the lower wing and machine guns mounted at the pilot's line of sight. In all, 1010 Pfalz D.III and Pfalz D.IIIa aircraft were built.
    
    In June 1917, the first Pfalz D.IIIs entered service with combat squadrons. The plane was used for bomber escort and for engaging enemy fighters and balloons. Pilots noted its exceptional cockpit visibility, good manoeuvrability, and stability when firing the machine guns; speed and climb rate were described as good. Some pilots claimed that its control sensitivity was even better than that of the Albatros D.V. Its structural durability permitted steep dives in combat and successful forced landings. English and French pilots claimed that one could shoot it down only when seriously wounding or killing the pilot. Its flight characteristics improved slightly when the Mercedes D.IIIa engine was fitted. The plane participated in battles over the Western and the Turkish fronts.

- name: S.E.5a
  description: |
    The S.E.5a (single-seat fighter, Scout Experimental 5a) was designed by the British company known as R.A.F. (Royal Aircraft Factory). The goal was to build a fighter around the 200hp Hispano-Suiza engine, which would make it to be fast and have a high climbing speed. To achieve this goal, engineers had to settle on a compromise. By making the wing profile thin, they simultaneously increased its surface area. This design featured ailerons in both the upper and lower wings. In total, 5269 planes were built by the end of the war.
    
    The plane’s first trial flight was performed in January 1917, and it saw action in June 1917 at the British No. 56 Squadron RFC. It was used to engage enemy fighters and balloons and to escort bombers; only rarely was it used to engage ground targets near the front lines. In evaluating the aircraft, pilots mentioned its structural durability, sufficient manoeuvrability, stability in dives and when firing machine guns, fine handling, and good sensitivity of controls at low speeds. When landing at high speed, the plane could not touch down due to its high wing lift. It is notable that most of the top British aces flew this type of plane. It was even given a nickname - “ace-maker.”
    
    During the aircraft’s service, the poor reliability of the Hispano-Suiza engine became apparent; as a result, the plane was also fitted with the more reliable Wolseley Viper engine (license-built by the British Hispano-Suiza factories). The landing gear structure had to be redesigned after frequent reports were made of it breaking upon landing. This involved changing its shape (metal welded tubes were replaced by a wooden frame). The aircraft participated in battles in Europe on the Western Front and in Macedonia and also in Mesopotamia and Palestine.

- name: Sopwith Camel
  description: |
    The Sopwith Camel\'s construction was based on that of its predecessor, the Sopwith Pup. Sopwith\'s chief designer Herbert Smith decided to somewhat alter the Pup’s design, since a newer, larger and heavier engine would have to be mounted. Some changes were made to the landing gear struts, the spacing of the wings and stabiliser were increased, and the fuselage acquired an extension to the cockpit\'s trailing edge, which looked rather like a camel’s hump. That \'hump\' is what gave the plane its name - the Sopwith Camel.
    
    A remarkable detail of the plane’s construction was its compactness: the pilot’s seat, fuel tanks, machine guns and engine were all installed very close together. In parallel with the work of the main Sopwith factory, the plane was also assembled by a number of other companies such as Ruston Proctor Co, Portholme Aerodrome Ltd, Boulton & Paul Ltd, British Caudron Co. Ltd, Clayton & Shuttleworth Ltd, Hooper & Co. Ltd and others. In total, about 5490 Camels were built. The Camel’s first flight trials were performed by the British No. 60 squadron in March of 1917, which were followed by a series of minor improvements to the plane’s construction. Production aircraft were first delivered to fighter squadrons in May of 1917. It was primarily used for destroying enemy aircraft and balloons, while from time to time it was also engaged in ground attack operations. English journalists referred to this plane as a “small and agile beast.”
    
    Camel pilots mentioned the plane’s well-balanced flight controls, the good upward view, and the high cruising speed. Due to the aircraft\'s unique balance, the plane could almost instantly change its heading, which made the Camel a dangerous opponent. The typical combat scenario for the Camel pilot was a dogfight at low and medium altitudes, where the Camel had the advantage in steep turns. Veterans were known to say, “Once you become a Camel pilot, you will fly it forever.” In addition to equipping British units, this plane was also piloted by four American squadrons of the U.S. Air Service and by some Belgian pilots.

- name: Sopwith Dolphin
  description: |
    The Sopwith Dolphin was designed by the Sopwith Aviation Company in Britain. In designing the aircraft, the flaws of the Sopwith Camel were taken into account. These included bad forward and upward visibility and difficulties of handling a rotary-powered plane. In response to the latter issue, the engineers elected to fit the new aircraft with an inline engine. The design featured a compact arrangement of the cockpit, fuel tanks, machine guns and engine. This resulted in the pilot’s head being level with the hatch on the upper wing. The radiators were moved to the sides of the fuselage and behind the cockpit. The first trial flights were made in May 1917. In addition to the Sopwith Aviation Company, several other companies manufactured the aircraft: Darracq, Hooper, and SACA. By the end of the war, 1532 planes of the type had been built.
    
    Operational evaluation of the Dolphin began with the British No. 56 Squadron on June 13, 1917. Several design improvements would follow. In January 1918, No. 19 Squadron became the first operational unit to receive production examples of the Dolphin. The type was employed against enemy fighters and balloons, especially at high altitudes, where it was superior to the Sopwith Camel. It was also used to bomb and strafe ground targets.
    
    Dolphin pilots noted the plane’s good balance of controls, perfect visibility upward and forward, but the downward visibility was obscured by the lower wings and the engine cowling. The plane was a formidable opponent, as it possessed the manoeuvrability of the Sopwith Camel and a speed and climb rate equal to that of the S.E.5a. Pilots often complained about the cockpit crumpling and its tendency to nose over on harsh landings. For a short period, French and American pilots flew these aircraft. It took part in battles over the Western Front.

- name: SPAD 13.C1
  description: |
    The SPAD S.XIII was designed as an improved version of the SPAD S.VII. While appearing externally similar to its predecessor, it was in fact a completely new design. A second machine gun and more a powerful engine were fitted. In addition, an auxiliary fuel tank was placed in the central section of the upper wing. The main fuel tank had outlines of the lower fuselage section. To the left and behind the cockpit was an installation for a reconnaissance camera or a bomb load. The aircraft’s first flight was made on the 4th of April 1917. The plane was manufactured by Bleriot, Levasseur, Bernard, Kellner, Safca, Borel, and Nieuport. In all, 8472 planes of the type were built.
    The S.XIII first appeared at the front in late summer-early fall 1917, being initially supplied to French fighter squadrons. It was mainly used for engaging enemy planes, escorting bombers, aerial mapping, and recon; rarely was it used for the bombing of ground targets near the front lines.
    French pilots were eager to receive the S.XIII. The second machine gun provided increased firepower, and the new engine allowed it to fly and climb faster than its predecessors. Its controls remained effective even at high altitudes. The only remaining drawback, owing to its thin wing profile, was its decreased sensitivity of controls at low speeds, which often resulted in a stall. In a dive and level flight, the SPAD S.XIII was one of the fastest aircraft of its time. Pilots who flew it remarked, “It dives faster than the wind!” It participated in battles on all fronts during WWI. French, British, American and Italian units were all equipped with the type.

    - Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator so they can be extended to maximum position only. Speed with extended landing flaps is limited to 140 mph.
    - Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. Since the landing gear wheels are relatively close to each other, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Airplane is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
    - The aircraft is equipped with a bottom formation light.
    - Standard gunsight is adjustable: both the target distance and target base can be set.
    - The gyroscopic gunsight automaticly calculates required angular deflection while firing at a target. It has 4 modes: fixed reticle, fixed and gyro reticle, gyro reticle, gyro reticle with the target range fixed at 150 yards (night mode). The angular deflection will be calculated correctly only if the target range is set properly. To set the range, adjust the target base first using separate controls and then set the range by adjusting the size of the rangefiding reticle to be the same as the target size.
    - Both gunsights have sliding sun-filters.'

    The U-2 aircraft was developed under N.N. Polikarpov supervision in 1923-1928. It was designed as a simple, sturdy, and easy to handle two-seater aircraft for flight schools. It went airborne for the first time on June 24, 1927, but many improvements to its design were made afterwards to improve its climb rate. The upgraded plane went into production in 1929 after the first flight on January 7, 1928.
    
    Flight instructors and pilot candidates liked the plane - it forgave the typical mistakes of the trainees, was hard to stall and easy to recover, predictable at high angles of attack and had a low landing speed. Many future aces learned to fly in this \'flying school-desk\'. It was the first aircraft for the majority of VVS pilots.
    
    Several modifications of this aircraft were developed: ambulance S-1 and S-2, passenger U-2SP and U-2L, agriculture U-2AP and military U-2VS. The military modification could carry up to 300 kg of bombs and was equipped with a defensive MG turret. During WWII, it was mainly used as a low-altitude bomber and recon plane. It was a very hard target for enemy fighters at low altitudes because of its low speed, resulting in its relatively high survivability rate. It was used by the famous "night witches", female pilots and navigators of 46th Guards night bomber regiment. The model was renamed to Po-2 to honor N.N. Polikarpov after his passing in 1944.
    
    Operational features:
    - There is no engine supercharger.
    - The fuel mixture control is manual: the mixture should be leaned as the altitude increases for optimal engine functioning and to reduce the fuel consumption while flying level.
    - The fixed pitch propeller requires controlling the engine RPM manually.
    - The tail skid is linked to the rudder (8° maximum tilt).
    - There are no wheel brakes.
    - There is no electric generator in the default aircraft configuration, so electric lights and Pitot tube warmer (which consumes up to 226W) are fed from 24V battery (10 Ah capacity at 1 A current in standard conditions). To power the RSI-4 radio station, GS-10-350 electric generator is installed along with it.
    - Please note that with all possible modifications and full fuel the total aircraft weight is 1390 kg, more than its maximum takeoff weight.'

    Combat debut: April 1943
    
    Operation features:
    - Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2300m altitude.
    - Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - The airplane can only be trimmed in the pitch axis.
    - Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be fully extended; gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
    - Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than 75%25 of its range. The tailwheel remains locked if pedals are deflected less than 75%25. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Fuel gauges are installed on left and right wing fuel tanks, outside of the cockpit. They show remaining fuel level only when there is less than 80 liters of fuel left in the tank.
    - The canopy has no emergency release. In order to bail out, you must slow below 550 kph to open the canopy.
    - The control system for the wing-mounted bomb racks only allows releasing of both bombs together.'

    Combat debut: May 1942
    
    Operation features:
    - Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2300m altitude.
    - Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
    - Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
    - Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
    - Airplane has only the pitch flight-control trimmer.
    - Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be fully extended; gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
    - Airplane has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The unlocked tailwheel has a 90° turn limit. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
    - Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
    - Fuel gauges are installed on left and right wing fuel tanks, outside of the cockpit. They show remaining fuel level only when there is less than 80 liters of fuel left in the tank.
    - It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
    - The control system for the wing-mounted bomb racks only allows releasing of both bombs together.
    - When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.'
